## Brief

#### Requirements
* Consume a public API
* Have several components
* The app can have a router - with several "pages"

## Planning

Before commencing the coding process, a wireframe was designed using Excalidraw. The wireframe encompasses five essential pages:

* Home Page: The homepage features a navigation bar that includes a "Home" link, allowing users to easily navigate back to the home page, as well as providing options to explore the "Characters" or "Movies" pages.
* Characters Page: Upon selecting the "Characters" link, users are presented with a page displaying all the Harry Potter characters, along with their names and corresponding images. Users have the ability to filter the characters based on Hogwarts houses or search for a specific character by name.
* Specific Character Page: Clicking on a particular character redirects users to a dedicated page showcasing comprehensive information such as the actor's name, date of birth, house, ancestry, and patronus.
* Movies Page: The "Movies" page provides an overview of all the Harry Potter movies.
* Specific Movie Page: By selecting a specific movie, users are redirected to a dedicated page presenting details such as the movie summary, director, release date, box office performance, and running time.
